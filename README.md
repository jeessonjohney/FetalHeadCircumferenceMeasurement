# FetalHeadCircumferenceMeasurement

Automatic Fetal Head Circumference Measurement from US-scan images

U-net Architecture was implemented to train the model

This project was done based on a challenge given by grand-challenge.org

The challenge was to determine the head circumference but I also implimented algorithm to find BPD (Biparietal diameter) and OFD (Occipital Frontal Diameter)

The Dataset can be downloaded from : https://hc18.grand-challenge.org/
